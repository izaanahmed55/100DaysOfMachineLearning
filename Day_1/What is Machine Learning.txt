Ques. What is Machine Learning?
Ans. It is a field of Computer Science that uses statistical techniques to give computer an ability to "learn" with data, without being explicitly programmed.

It can be useful when
- you are unable to cover all the scenarios / edge cases
- you want to classify things with alot of variations
- you want to do find a hidden info out of a data (Data Mining)



- ML has been there for past 40-50 years but it got hyped up after 2010.
