TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING
==========================

1. Supervised Machine Learning
- When we have input and outputs and we need to recognise relation between them so that we can predict output for a new input. That's what Supervised Learning is!
- It can further be divide into two parts
  * Regression (When output is usually Numerical e.g. age, cgpa etc.)
  * Classification (When output is usually Categorical e.g. gender, spam/not spam, nationality etc.)

2. Unsupervised Machine Learning
- When we only have inputs and eventually predicts output over that using 
  * Clustering (Plot the data on a graph and put the similar ones into groups)
  * Dimentionality Reduction (Combining the relatable columns to reduce dimensions/input columns and this is also known as Feature Extraction)
  * Anomaly Detection (Detecting Outliers and eventually omitting them)
  * Association Rule Learning (Finding relation in between two data columns and then keeping them together e.g. Products setting in a supermarket)

3. Semi-Supervised Machine Learning
- We label just a few data and the remaining data gets labelled all by itself.

4. Reinforcement Machine Learning
- We donot provide any data initially.
- Learns by experience like Human e.g. Self Driving Car
- Observes and Learn eventually with time and experiences
