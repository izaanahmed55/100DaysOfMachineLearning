***Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Putting Intelligence into a Machine
- Initially expert systems like Chess game were considered as the future of AI, later the concept failed as there were flaws in it as it could not tackle a tricky/fuzzy logic. That's when Machine Learning was introduced.
 
**Machine Learning (ML)
- We never do explicit programming for our problems/scenarios.
- Rules will be generated on the basis of Data
- Learning Pattern with time

*Deep Learning (DL)
- It follows the same process/flow as Machine Learning
- Different Algorithms from ML
- Inspired by Biology
- Inspired by Human Brain, although doesn't work exactly like that

Q. What brought Deep Learning?
A. In Machine Learning, we need to specify feature of an indivisual however Deep Learning recognises them itself. Deep Learning works layer by layer and goes deeper. Machine learning's accuracy increases to a certain point when provided with data and gradually becomes stable. However, Deep learning's accuracy keeps increasing with Data.
